              <div class="post">
                <h2 class="title">File Formats</h2>
                <div class="entry">
				<p>
				We use the popular Metis input/output formats for I/O (and extend them in
				certain cases). This applies to files for 
				input graphs and solutions (partition/cluster assignments). All files are simple
				ASCII text files. In the following descriptions, <i>n</i> denotes the number 
				of vertices in the graph.
				</p>
				<h4>Graph Format</h4>
				<p>
				Note that for the Challenge the input graphs might be seen as unweighted,
				i. e. weighted instances might be seen as having unit weights for both vertices
				and edges. Details on this aspect will be announced later.
				</p>
				<p>
				Following the <a href="data/manual.ps">
				Metis User's Guide, Version 4.0</a>, the graph files may contain
				comment lines that begin with the character '%'. Such lines are ignored.
				At its simplest a correct input contains <i>n+1</i> uncommented lines. The first
				of these lines contains either two, three, or four integers, separated by space.
				The first two obligatory entries are the number of vertices and
				the number of edges in the graph. Note that in this case the number of edges is only half of
				the sum of the vertex degrees. The third and fourth parameter in the first line are optional
				and control input of weighted graphs. For details on weighted graphs
				see Section 4.5.1 of the <a href="data/manual.ps">
				Metis User Guide, Version 4.0</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Important:</b>
				There is one exception to the use of the format described in Section 4.5.1. If the
				graph contains self-loops and/or multiple edges, the third parameter in the first line
				is set to <i>100</i>. Since Metis does not allow such graphs, this extension of the format
				is necessary. To exclude these graphs upfront would mean to exclude many real-world instances.
				Also note that in this case the second parameter is the actual number of <i>edge entries</i> in the
				file, i. e., the sum of the vertex degrees. This deviation is necessary due to self-loops.
				They do not appear twice in the file, as undirected (= bidirected) edges do.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the unweighted case, the remaining <i>n</i> lines contain neighbor lists
				for each vertex from <i>1</i> to <i>n</i> in order. These lists are sets of integers
				separated by spaces and contain all the neighbors of a given vertex. The neighbors
				may be listed in any order. Note that vertices are numbered <i>1</i> to <i>n</i>,
				<b>not</b> from <i>0</i> to <i>n-1</i>.
				For possible extensions, please refer again to Section 4.5.1 in the 
				<a href="data/manual.ps">
				Metis User Guide, Version 4.0</a>. You will find there examples of small graphs
				and their respective representations, too.
				</p>
				<h4>Output Format</h4>
				<p>
				The partition/cluster assignment files have <i>n</i> uncommented lines.
				In line <i>i</i> the assignment value for vertex <i>i</i> is given as an integer
				between <i>0</i> and <i>p-1</i>, where <i>p</i> is the number of partitions.
				</p>
				<h4>Geometry Format</h4>
				<p>
				Vertex coordinates can optionally be supplied in a separate file. This file should
				have the same name as the graph file. But instead of the file extension 
				<i>.graph</i>, the coordinate file has the extension <i>.xyz</i>.
				These coordinate files must have <i>n</i> uncommented lines, with line <i>i</i>
				containing the coordinates of vertex <i>i</i>. Each line must contain one, two, or
				three floating-point values, depending on the geometry type.
