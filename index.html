				<p>
				As stated on their <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/">main website</a>, 
				the "DIMACS Implementation Challenges address 
				questions of determining realistic algorithm performance where worst case analysis is overly
				pessimistic and probabilistic models are too unrealistic: experimentation can provide guides 
				to realistic algorithm performance where analysis fails." 
				</p>
				<p>
				For the 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge, the two related problems of graph partitioning 
				and graph clustering were chosen. Graph partitioning and graph clustering are among the
				aforementioned questions or problem areas where theoretical and practical results deviate 
				significantly from each other, so that experimental outcomes are of particular interest.

                <div class="entry">
				<p>
				Graph partitioning and graph clustering are ubiquitous subtasks in many application areas.
				Generally speaking, both techniques aim at the identification of vertex subsets with many 
				internal and few external edges.
				To name only a few, problems addressed by graph partitioning and graph clustering algorithms are:
				<ul>
				<li>
				What are the communities within an (online) social network?
				</li>
				<li>
				How do I speed up a numerical simulation by mapping it efficiently onto a parallel computer?
				</li>
				<li>
				How must components be organized on a computer chip such that they can communicate efficiently
				with each other?
				</li>
				<li>
				What are the segments of a digital image?
				</li>
				<li>
				Which functions are certain genes (most likely) responsible for?
				</li>				
				</ul> 
				</p>

                <h2 class="title">Challenge Goals</h2>
                <div class="entry">
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				One goal of this Challenge is to create a reproducible picture of the state-of-the-art in the area of graph
				partitioning (GP) and graph clustering (GC) algorithms. To this end we are identifying a standard set of benchmark
				instances and generators.
				</li>
				<li>
				Moreover, after initiating a discussion with the community, we would like to establish the most appropriate problem
				formulations and objective functions for a variety of applications. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Another goal is to enable current researchers to compare their codes with each other, in hopes of identifying
				the most effective algorithmic innovations that have been proposed.
				</li>
				<li>				
				The final goal is to publish proceedings containing results presented at the Challenge workshop, and a book
				containing the best of the proceedings papers.
				</li>
				</ul>

                <h2 class="title">Problems Addressed</h2>
                <div class="entry">
				<p>
				The precise problem formulations can be found in the document describing
				<a href="data/dimacs10-rules.pdf">scoring rules and objective functions</a>.
				The descriptions below served as a starting point for the problem definitions.						
				<ul>
  				  <li><b>Graph partitioning:</b>
				  <p>
    				The most common formulation of the graph partitioning problem for an undirected graph
    				G = (V,E) asks for a division of V into k pairwise disjoint subsets (partitions) such that
    				all partitions are of approximately equal size and the edge-cut, i.e., the total number of
    				edges having their incident nodes in different subdomains, is minimized. The problem
    				is known to be NP-hard. Other important variations of this problem exist. They are often
					subsumed under the term graph partitioning as well. In the Challenge we consider two
					objective functions, see the <a href="data/dimacs10-rules.pdf">scoring rules and objective functions</a>.
    			  </p>
				  </li>
				  <li><b>Graph clustering:</b>
				  <p>
				  Clustering is an important tool for investigating the structural properties of data.
				  Generally speaking, clustering refers to the grouping of objects such that objects in the
				  same cluster are more similar to each other than to objects of different clusters. The
				  similarity measure depends on the underlying application. Clustering graphs usually refers
				  to the identification of vertex subsets (clusters) that have significantly more internal
				  edges (to vertices of the same cluster) than external ones (to vertices of another cluster).
